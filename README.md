# CS1 Sneaky Rook
Sneaky Rook project coded in pure C with no IDE for Computer Science 1

Objectives:
- Design a solution that has a worst-case runtime more efficient than ```O(m + n)``` linear runtime.
- Design a solution that can determine which rooks, as placed on an arbitrarily sized chess board, can attach one another based on the rules of chess.
- Work with a base 26 numbered coordinate scheme.
- Use structs to hold coordinate sets for each rook.
- Adheer with supplied function requirements for each function.

Note: These programs from CS1 were critical in my development of C programming skills. I encourage the reader to open the PDF file supplied in this repositiory, or any other repository labeled ```CS1_```, and to browse through the program requirements.
